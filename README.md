# Shape Tracker

#### An application that checks various shapes for their properties and types.

#### By Brian Scherner

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET

## Description

This application allows users to input numbers for a triangle or rectangle to determine it's type and other properties. It contains functionality for determining an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle, and for determining the area and type of a rectangle. Users can also view a list of all triangles they have created, and clear the list and start over if they wish to do so.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called `ShapeTracker`.
3. In the command line, run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning as desired, although I plan to add UI functionality to run it outside of the console later.
