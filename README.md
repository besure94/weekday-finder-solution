# Weekday Finder

#### An application that allows users to find what weekday a date occurred on.

#### By Brian Scherner

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET

## Description

This application allows users to enter a date in 'year, month, day' format (ex: 1918/7/4), and they can find out what day of the week that date occurred on. Any date from January 1, 0001 to December 31, 9999 is considered valid for this application.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called `WeekdayFinder`.
3. In the command line, run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning as desired, although I plan to add UI functionality to run it outside of the console later.
